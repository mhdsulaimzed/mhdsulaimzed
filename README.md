Backend Developer | Auth & Security | Cloud Infrastructure | Systems Programming

### About Me
Backend and systems developer working at the intersection of **authentication, distributed systems, and operating systems**.  
I focus on building secure, scalable platforms while exploring the internals of **Linux, kernel modules, and low-level tooling**.  
Curious about how systems work under the hood and how to make them run faster, safer, and at scale.

### Current Focus
- Authentication & Authorization (Keycloak, LDAP, custom workflows)  
- Multi-tenant SaaS and cloud-native architectures (AWS, Azure, OCI)  
- Systems programming in **Go, Python ,C **  
- Linux internals and kernel-space development  
- High Performance Computing (HPC) with Slurm  

---

### Learning & Growth
- Advanced Go and C for backend + systems engineering  
- gRPC and Kubernetes for distributed systems  
- CUDA C++ for GPU-accelerated workloads  
- Building Linux from scratch and experimenting with kernel subsystems  

---

### Perspective
Software should be more than just functional  it should be **transparent, efficient, and resilient**.  
My work is driven by the belief that understanding systems at the lowest level leads to building better abstractions at the highest.
